### Additional Notes

- 777 has an original BPM of 777, due to application restraints, we scaled it down to 194.25 which is 777 scaled down 1 time with a factor of 4
- Some charts have sections that need 4 fingers. This doesn't change the initial premise of the charts as most of the chart is playable by index fingers only
