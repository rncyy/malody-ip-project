# Leveling System

The leveling system of the charts included in this repository may follow either of the two leveling systems listed below

## Old Leveling System

This leveling system respects the `Unleash` tag on a song by having the song leveled -2 steps from its actual level.

_Example:_

- `4K IP PR Lv. 15 Unleash!`

> The actual level of this chart is 17

- `4K IP PR Lv. 13+ Unleash!`

> The actual level of this chart is 15+

## New Leveling System (June 2020)

This leveling system ignores the `Unleash` tag on a song and is leveled as is. This is distinguishable because newer charts only have the `Unleash` when the level is higher than 16

_Example:_

- `4K IP PR Lv. MAXX Unleash!`

> The actual level of this chart is 18

- `4K IP PR Lv. 16+ Unleash!`

> The actual level of this chart is 16+

## Enhanced Leveling System (October 2020)

This new leveling system will remove the `Unleash` tag, and remove the +'s in the level numbers. The maximum level of a chart can now be 20. All charts will have their levels adjusted accordingly.
